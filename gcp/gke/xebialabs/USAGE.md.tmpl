# Creating a simple GKE Cluster in Google Cloud 

## Prerequisites
If you do not have XL Release and XL Deploy running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin them up.

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.
       - docker-compose up -d
    3: Configure xl-deploy within xl-release
       - xl apply -f configure-xl-devops-platform.yaml
    4: Copy your account.json credential file generated earlier into the ./terraform directory

To deploy this blueprint, follow the steps below:

1. Apply the generated YAML configurations using the XL CLI. Open up a terminal and CD into the folder where you generated the configuration.

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

2. Go to XL Release, click on `Design`, then navigate to  the `{{$cluster}}` folder and look for the "{{$cluster}}-create" under `Templates`, and start a new release from it.
3. Once you are done, go to XL Release, look for the "{{$cluster}}-destroy" template in the same location, and start it to automatically rollback and destroy the resources you created.
